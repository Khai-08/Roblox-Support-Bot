# Roblox Support Bot
 A support bot designed for Roblox Game Communities inspired by Davy Jones Bot (Fisch Support Server). This bot helps Discord servers handle Reports and Appeals form. Ideal for Roblox developers who want to offer support inside their game’s Discord server—without coding a custom bot from scratch.
